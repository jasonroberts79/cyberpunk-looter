# Introduction to Agentic RAG Systems

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with large language models to provide more accurate and contextual responses.

## Key Components

1. **Vector Database**: Stores document embeddings for efficient similarity search
2. **Embedding Model**: Converts text into numerical representations
3. **Language Model**: Generates responses based on retrieved context
4. **Retrieval System**: Finds relevant information from the knowledge base

## Benefits of RAG

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data
- Allows AI to work with private or domain-specific knowledge
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning for many use cases
- Easy to update knowledge base without retraining models

## Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG systems add autonomous decision-making capabilities, allowing the AI to:
- Decide when to retrieve information
- Choose which retrieval strategies to use
- Combine multiple sources of information
- Take actions based on retrieved context
