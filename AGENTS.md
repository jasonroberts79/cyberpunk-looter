# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

## Standard: Uncle Bob

Conduct comprehensive code reviews using Uncle Bob's Clean Code and SOLID principles to ensure high-quality, maintainable software by focusing on structural elements, meaningful names, and proper error handling when assessing recently written or modified code. :
* No rules defined yet.
